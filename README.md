# animal-kingdom
# Encapsulation:

Private properties (_name, _classification, _isColdBlooded, and _hasBackbone) are encapsulated within the Animal class.
Getter methods are used to access these private properties.

# Inheritance:

The classes Anthropoda, Fish, Amphibia, Reptiles, Aves, and Mammals inherit from the Animal class using the extends keyword.
The super() function is called in the constructors of the derived classes to invoke the constructor of the base class.

# Abstraction:

The displayInfo method provides a high-level abstraction to display basic information about the animal.

# Polymorphism:

The sound method is a common method in the base class (Animal), and it is overridden in the Anthropoda, Fish, Amphibia, Reptiles, Aves, and Mammals classes, demonstrating polymorphism.
